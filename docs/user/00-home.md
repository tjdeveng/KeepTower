# Welcome to KeepTower 🗝️

**A secure, modern password manager for Linux with military-grade encryption and built-in error correction.**

## What is KeepTower?

KeepTower is a native GTK4 password manager designed for Linux users who value security, privacy, and reliability. Your passwords are encrypted locally with AES-256-GCM and protected by optional Reed-Solomon error correction—ensuring your data survives bit rot and storage corruption.

## Key Features

✨ **Military-Grade Encryption** - AES-256-GCM with PBKDF2 key derivation
🏛️ **FIPS 140-3 Ready** - Uses FIPS-approved algorithms, OpenSSL FIPS provider support
👥 **Multi-User Support** - V2 vaults with role-based access (Admin/Standard)
🔐 **YubiKey Hardware 2FA** - Optional hardware-based second factor authentication
📤 **Import/Export** - CSV, KeePass XML, and 1Password 1PIF formats
🛡️ **Error Correction** - Reed-Solomon FEC (5-50% redundancy) protects against data corruption
💾 **Automatic Backups** - Configurable rolling backups keep your data safe
�� **Modern UI** - Clean GTK4/libadwaita interface with dark mode support
🔒 **Memory Protection** - Sensitive data locked in RAM, never swapped to disk
🔐 **Strong Password Validation** - Prevents weak passwords and common patterns
🔍 **Password History** - Prevents password reuse with configurable depth
📦 **Zero Dependencies on Cloud** - Your data stays on your machine
